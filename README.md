### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculate a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Newsletter SignUp
This project is an MVC web application that allows users to enter their name and email address to signup to a newsletter. The user is given confirmation upon signing up.
There is also an admin page that allows the person running the newsletter to view everyone that has signed up.

### BlackJack App
This project is a console application that allows a user to play BlackJack. The user is prompted to enter their name, amount of chips and how much they'd like to bet. A dealer will then deal the cards and the player may choose to hit or stand. Object Oriented Programming concepts are utilized throughout the application in various ways.
